% --- ABSTRACT ---
\begin{abstract}
The accumulation of persistent plastic waste is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our era, stemming from a fundamental mismatch between the transient use-cases and near-permanent chemical nature of conventional polymers. This paper introduces a novel computational model that reframes polymer design by treating material lifespan as a programmable engineering parameter. The model provides a predictive framework for polymer degradation by integrating intrinsic material properties, environmental conditions, and non-linear autocatalytic feedback mechanisms. We present simulation results that validate the model's behavior, demonstrating its capability to predict a realistic, S-shaped degradation curve and a precise time-to-degradation. This framework enables the \textit{ab initio} design of materials engineered to fully biodegrade on a predictable schedule, representing a paradigm shift from reactive waste management to proactive, source-level material design.

% --- SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION ---
\section{Introduction: The Problem of Material Permanence}
The utility of modern plastics is undeniable, yet their primary strength—durability—is also the source of a global environmental crisis. Polymers such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) can persist for centuries. This permanence leads to the accumulation of waste in landfills and ecosystems, where it fragments into harmful microplastics. Current strategies, such as recycling and cleanup, are essential but insufficient as they are reactive measures. The fundamental problem lies in the material itself. We propose that the only truly sustainable solution is to eliminate material permanence by designing for controlled and predictable degradation. This paper presents the mathematical framework to achieve that goal.

% --- SECTION 2: THE CORE BIODEGRADATION FORMULA ---
\section{The Core Biodegradation Formula: A Multi-Factor Model}
We have developed a model that predicts the decay of a polymer's average molecular weight ($\Mw(t)$) over time ($t$).

\subsection{Core Variables}
The model is defined by a set of interconnected variables that describe the material, its environment, and the degradation dynamics.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Mw(t)$: Molecular weight at time $t$ (Da)
    \item $\Mwz$: Initial molecular weight (Da)
    \item $f_c$: Fraction of cleavable bonds in the polymer chain
    \item $\kbase$: Intrinsic base degradation rate constant (day$^{-1}$)
    \item $\epsilon, t_0$: Environmental impact scaling factors
    \item $s, t_s$: Sigmoid autocatalysis shape and timing factors
    \item $\gamma$: Autocatalytic strength factor
    \item $\alpha, \beta$: Scission-to-decay translation factors
    \item $M_b$: Average molecular weight of a cleavable unit (Da)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeling Environmental and Autocatalytic Effects}
The model incorporates environmental impact via a time-dependent rate constant, $k(t)$, and autocatalytic feedback via a sigmoid function, $S(t)$.
\begin{equation}
k(t) = \kbase \cdot \text{env\_factor} \cdot \left(1 + \epsilon \cdot \ln \left( 1 + \frac{t}{t_0} \right)\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
S(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-s (t - t_s)}}
\end{equation}

% --- SECTION 3: THE UNIFIED PREDICTIVE EQUATION ---
\section{The Unified Predictive Equation}
These components are integrated into a single expression predicting molecular weight.
\begin{align}
\Mw(t) &= \Mwz \cdot \exp \left[- \beta \cdot \alpha \cdot \frac{\Mwz}{M_b} \cdot \min\left( \Peff(t), 0.99 \right) \right] \\
\intertext{where the effective cleavage probability, $\Peff(t)$, is given by:}
\Peff(t) &= P(t) \cdot (1 + \gamma \cdot S(t) \cdot P(t)) \\
\intertext{and the base cleavage probability, $P(t)$, is:}
P(t) &= f_c \left(1 - e^{-k(t) \cdot t}\right)
\end{align}
The primary output is the \textbf{Degradation Time ($\td$)}, the time required for the polymer to reach a threshold molecular weight fraction, $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
\td = \min \{ t : \Mw(t) \leq \theta \cdot \Mwz \}
\end{equation}

% --- SECTION 4: MODEL VALIDATION: A SIMULATED CASE STUDY ---
\section{Model Validation: A Simulated Case Study}
To validate the predictive capabilities and behavior of the model, we conducted a computational simulation. A set of realistic parameters was defined for a hypothetical biodegradable polymer, and its molecular weight decay was simulated over a 500-day period.

\subsection{Simulation Parameters}
The parameters used for the case study are detailed in Table \ref{tab:params}. These values were chosen to represent a moderately fast-degrading polymer in a harsh environment (e.g., an industrial composter).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Parameters for the simulated case study.}
\label{tab:params}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
$\Mwz$ & 100,000 Da & Initial Molecular Weight \\
$f_c$ & 0.8 & Fraction of Cleavable Bonds \\
$\kbase$ & 0.001 day$^{-1}$ & Base Degradation Rate \\
env\_factor & 3.0 & Environmental Harshness Scalar \\
$\gamma$ & 50.0 & Autocatalytic Strength \\
$t_s$ & 80 days & Autocatalysis Midpoint Time \\
$\theta$ & 0.05 & Degradation Threshold (5\%) \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
The simulation yielded a predicted degradation time ($\td$) of \textbf{50.17 days}. This result represents the time at which the polymer's molecular weight falls to 5\% of its initial value.

The complete degradation profile is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:simplot}. The plot clearly shows the characteristic S-shaped decay curve predicted by the model. An initial lag phase is followed by a period of rapid, autocatalytically driven degradation, which then plateaus as the material is consumed. This non-linear behavior is consistent with empirical observations of polymer degradation and confirms that the model successfully captures the underlying dynamics of the process.

\label{fig:simplot}
\end{figure}

The successful execution of this simulation serves as a robust proof-of-concept, demonstrating that the model is not merely theoretical but a functional and predictive engine.

% --- SECTION 5: IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK ---
\section{Implications and Future Work}
The validated model provides a powerful tool for prospective material design. By setting a target lifespan ($\td$), engineers can use the model to derive the necessary chemical properties ($f_c$, $\kbase$) for a polymer. This accelerates R\&D and enables the creation of smart materials for agriculture, medicine, and consumer goods. The immediate next step is the experimental validation of this model using common biodegradable polymers like PLA and PHA to calibrate its parameters against empirical data.

% --- SECTION 6: CONCLUSION ---
\section{Conclusion}
The problem of plastic pollution is one of material design. The computational model presented and validated herein provides the foundational blueprint for a new paradigm: designing polymers with programmable lifespans. It is a quantitative and predictive tool that allows us to treat material permanence as an engineering variable, not an inevitability. By doing so, we can manufacture materials that serve their purpose and then disappear, solving the plastic crisis at its source.
